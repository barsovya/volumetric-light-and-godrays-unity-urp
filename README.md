# volumetric-lights-and-godrays-unity-urp
"Volumetric Lights And GodRays Unity Urp" is the perfect, easy and cheap way to simulate godrays, depth and volume.

Engine: Unity 2020+, 2021, 2022(tested)
Pipeline: URP-only

One day I was looking for a solution for volumetric god rays. 
It came as a surprise to me that all the proposed solutions were either worse than I was looking for, or contained functionality I didn't need.
I'm just giving you free access to a ready-made solution that I plan to improve in the future.
And I want the Unity community to continue to progress. 
And for indie developers on URP there were more options for solving basic tasks.

Peace ✌️

__*Does not work from a local light source!* Works with global direction light only.__
Below is an example of a scene with night lighting.
